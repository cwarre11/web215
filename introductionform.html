					required>I graduated high school in 2016 from Warrensburg-Latham High School, and started that fall at Parkland College. I only finished my freshman year there and my                              life fell apart so I dropped out. I moved 12 hours away and started at CPCC in Fall of 2019. I figured if I moved far away from the excuses I was making to                                 keep myself from going back to school I’d have to go back, and it’s working!</textarea>

					required>In high school I did dual credit classes through the Heartland Technical Academy, which is through Richland Community College. That’s when I started messing                           around with Raspberry Pi’s and decided at least to a point that coding was exciting, even though it irritated me, but I loved being able to problem solve and                               figure out what I was doing wrong. I’m working on an associate degree in Full Stack Programming currently at CPCC, and plan to be finished in May of                                        2022!</textarea>
